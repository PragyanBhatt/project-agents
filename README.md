# Project Title: **Agents from Scratch**

## Project Description
This project aims to create intelligent agents entirely from scratch. The goal is to explore the fundamental principles of agent design, from basic behavior modeling to advanced decision-making mechanisms. The project showcases a complete pipeline of agent development, including logic, algorithms, and integrations.

## Features
- Design and implementation of agents.
- Customizable behavior for specific tasks.
- Environment simulation and interaction.
- Scalable architecture for future agent enhancements.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PragyanBhatt/project-agents.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd agents
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage
### Running the Agents
1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```
2. Run the main script to observe agent behaviors:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Customizing Agents
Modify the `agents_config.py` file to customize agent properties, behaviors, and environments.
